### Hi there! 👋

> A time capsule that allows the user to relive precious moments of their lives.

> With this app you can record a memory adding a description and an image for that incredible moment. Inside your account you can access a timeline with all the registered memories.

> The objective of this project was to improve my UX and UI skills, the improvement of tools for web development such as Next, React, Tailwind, Typescript and also user authentication with github's OAuth service.
